					WiFiReminder is a tweak for everyone!<br/><br/>
					Who hasnâ€™t been in a situation where you need to turn off your Wi-Fi connection to either save battery or to quickly switch from a slow Wi-Fi to LTE just to show someone something or to find something quickly?<br/><br/>
					If you ever see yourself in this situation, this is certainly your tweak!<br/><br/>
					WiFiReminder will notify you after a designated amount of time, and give you the ability to not waste mobile data when you could be using your home Wi-Fi!<br/>
					You have to try it out!<br/><br/>
					Options to configure in settings.
